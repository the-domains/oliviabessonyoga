About

Olivia has been a dedicated yogi since 2005\. She completed her first training with Paul Dallaghan of Yoga Thailand in 2008 and loved the meditative self practice of Ashtanga for many years following. Olivia developed her teaching skills under the guidance of Denis Juelicher whilst studying further with Lorraine Rushton in the area of kids yoga and yoga therapy.   

The demands of becoming a mother and the journey into parenthood cultivated a strong desire to explore deeper the transformational journey of womanhood. Olivia studied with Judy Mort, Artemis Rising, a year long "Women's Spiral of Transformation" and found that working with the seasons and honouring the natural cycles of the female body fosters a more holistic approach in all of life.

Olivia is currently studying online in the Sadie Nardini core strength vinyasa technique as well as pursuing further in-depth studies in yoga therapy, meditation and restorative yoga to become a recognised yoga therapist.

Olivia's deepest wish is to help you remember how to connect, be still and let your body, mind and spirit heal through holistic yoga.
