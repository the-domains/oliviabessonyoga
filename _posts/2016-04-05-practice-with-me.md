# Practice with me 

Yoga is a practice which enables you to achieve balance and happiness in your life. We do this by connecting with our source - our divine intuitive self which guides us to wisdom with a sense of relaxation, freedom and security.

"We have to dive deeper into ourselves to discover the true desires and aspirations or our spirit, of our true selves. With this knowledge we can formulate our aims and philosophy or discover whether they are complimentary or detrimental." Swami Akhandananda Saraswati

Gradually incorporating yogic practices into your lifestyle, on a day by day basis, will allow you to balance your life intuitively. Holistic yoga embodies all of the [eight limbs of yoga][0].

Latest science is beginning to reveal the powerful connection between the mind and the body. The physical practice of asana and pranayama together with concentration and meditation - all practiced with learned discipline over time - make for a happy, healthy life. 

My greatest reward is when students tell me that yoga has changed their lives - and it starts with just showing up to class. We begin to see how we simply cannot live with out it!
